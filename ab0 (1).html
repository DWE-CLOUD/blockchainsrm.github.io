      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
  I am a cybersecurity and AI researcher with a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in developing new AI-powered tools and techniques to defend against cyberattacks. I have worked on a variety of projects in this area, including:

  <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <li>Developing new methods for detecting and preventing malware attacks, such as using machine learning to identify malicious patterns in network traffic.</li>
    <li>Developing new ways to secure AI systems from adversarial attacks, such as using differential privacy to protect the privacy of training data.</li>
    <li>Designing new AI-powered security tools that can be used by businesses and individuals to protect themselves from cyberattacks.</li>
  </ul>

  In addition to my research, I am also passionate about educating others about cybersecurity and AI. I regularly give talks and workshops on these topics, and I am also involved in developing educational resources for students and teachers.In addition to that my interests also lie in playing football , basketball and reading novels .

  I believe that cybersecurity and AI are two of the most important technologies of our time. Cybersecurity is essential for protecting our critical infrastructure and our personal information from cyberattacks, and AI is transforming many industries and aspects of our lives. I am excited to be working at the intersection of these two fields, and I am committed to using my skills to make the world a safer and more secure place.

  My current research interests include developing new AI-powered methods for detecting and preventing advanced persistent threats (APTs), and developing new ways to secure AI systems from supply chain attacks. I am also interested in the ethical and social implications of AI, and I am committed to developing AI systems that are used for good.
 
I want to develop new and innovative technologies that can help to protect our world from cyberattacks and make AI systems more secure. I also want to educate others about cybersecurity and AI so that they can protect themselves and their organizations from cyberattacks.
